# 8051-Assembly-Program-to-reverse-the-elements-in-an-array

---

### AIM

To write a program for 8051 to get n size of array and print the array in reversed order in a different memory location.

---

### SOFTWARE REQUIRED

- Keil ÂµVision IDE
- Personel computer

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Start the program.
2. Move the value from memory location 30H into accumulator A.
3. Copy the value of A into register R2 (used as a loop counter).
4. If A = 0, jump to DONE and stop execution.
5. Add 30H to A to form the starting address, store it in R0.
6. Load R1 with 40H (destination start address).
7. Copy data byte from source (@R0) to destination (@R1).
8. Decrement R0, increment R1, and decrement loop counter R2.
9. Repeat step 7 until R2 = 0.
10. End the program (infinite jump at DONE).

### PROGRAM

```asm
ORG 0000H
MOV A,30H
MOV R2,A
JZ DONE
ADD A,#30H
MOV R0,A
MOV R1,#40H
AGAIN:
MOV A,@R0
MOV @R1,A
DEC R0
INC R1
DJNZ R2,AGAIN
DONE:
SJMP $
END
```
